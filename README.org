=search-scope-mode= – Emacs extension to search and replace things in a scope

* Background

I had started to develop =search-scope-mode= as a part of [[https://github.com/zepp/.emacs.d][my]] Emacs configuration then decided to move one to a standalone repository. It was developed from scratch to make my duties easier.

It is build on top of following Emacs extensions:
+ =project= – default extension to work with a source code tree
+ =thingatpt= – extension to get a ‘thing’ at point (symbol, word, etc)

Core concept is to reduce a number of files and directories (search scope) as much as possible to make a search more effective and precise.

* Terms

+ scope – part of a project to search in
+ root – root directory of a scope
+ composite – several files (parts) that should be considered as a whole

Scope could contain a number of composites.
